#   // Definition Function Definition:

#   function composition is a technique in which you combine two or more 
#   functions to produce a new function. The idea is to take output of one 
#   function and use it as input  for another.
 
 # Example 1: in the example 1 you seen that we have 2 function that perform different functionality function f increament + 2, and function g multiply it with 3
 # and their is composedFunction that take one argument and you seen the we group two function so one function output is the input of second function.

 # WHY WE USE IT?
 # breaking down complexity , reuseable component, readable and declarative code and easy unit testing.
